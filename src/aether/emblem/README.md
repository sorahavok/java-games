# Aether Emblem (2007)
## Background
This game was created as a final project for my Computer Science AP class in 2007. It was my first year working with Java and also my first large project. I had a lot planned for this game when I started however school like all things in life has deadlines.

## Inspiration
This game is a clone of Fire Emblem, Even the spites are taken from the game. I was playing Fire Emblem at the time and it seemed like a good project to attempt due to its turn based nature.
