# Tetris (2012)
Second Clone of Tetris.

This version of tetris was made to experiment with using XML documents to store the state of the game. There are no defined pieces in the code because they reside in the XML file. This allows for the player to create new pieces to use and allows for the pieces to be stored across launches. The same is true for the controls. This game also uses reflection heavily for setup.
